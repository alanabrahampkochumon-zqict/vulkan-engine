# Modern C++ Project Template

A high-performance boilerplate for C++ development featuring CMake integration, Google Test (GTest) for unit testing, and Google Benchmark for performance analysis.

# Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system PATH:

- <a href="https://cmake.org/download/" target="_blank">CMake</a> (3.25+): Build system generator.

- <a href="https://git-scm.com/install/windows" target="_blank">Git</a>: Required for FetchContent dependency management.

- <a href="https://git-scm.com/install/windows" target="_blank">Doxygen(Doxywizard)</a> (Optional): Required to generate HTML/PDF documentation.

- <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/download.html" target="_blank">Clang-Format</a> : Required for automated code style enforcement.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Initialize the build system and download dependencies.
Bash

`cmake -B build`

### Compilation

Compile the entire project, including tests and benchmarks.
Bash

`cmake --build build`

### Developer Utilities

Run these targets to maintain code quality and documentation.

- Auto-Format: `cmake --build build --target format`

- Generate Docs: cmake `--build build --target docs`

## Build Configurations (Windows)

The template includes two specialized batch scripts for rapid environment setup:
Script Description Features

_genStrict.bat_ Production/CI Mode Enables AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and treats all compiler warnings as errors (/W4 /WX).

_genNoStrict.bat_ Development Mode Standard build without strict flags for faster iteration and debugging.

**Note: You must run a configuration command (or script) before executing any --build targets.**

## Doxygen Configuration
Use the <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html" target="_blank">Doxygen Wizard</a> to customize your project's configuration file.
